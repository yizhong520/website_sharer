My Heroku url: https://fast-retreat-71398.herokuapp.com/


**1. What additional piece(s) of information about a url your previewer gets and displays. Also copy in a url that we can use to see it work**

I also included og:type at the top of the previewer.
You could see it using the movie site example: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3281548/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0


**2. What visual style change(s) you made on the url preview html, and why you think that is an improvement (this can be short, like just one sentence)**

I included some line breaks between each section so the layout could look clearer. I also changed the font size and style of the title and description paragraph because the original stype is too plain.


**3. The names of other students who helped you directly with your code (or say that none did)**

After finished coding, I went over spec again with Qiaoyi Zhang to see if any of us is missing any requirement.
